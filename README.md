# XTT-CPP: C++ wrappers for the XTT IoT security protocol

This project provides two C++ APIs for the C-based XTT
reference implementation [here](https://github.com/xaptum/xtt):
- `libxtt-cpp`:
  - A mostly-one-to-one C++ version of the C API provided [here](https://github.com/xaptum/xtt)
- `libxtt-asio`:
  - A higher-level API that builds upon `libxtt-cpp` and uses the [Boost ASIO](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/doc/html/boost_asio.html)
    library to perform all necessary network I/O asynchronously

## Installation

`xtt-cpp` is available for the following distributions. It may also be
built from source.

### Debian (Jessie or Stretch)

``` bash
# Install the Xaptum API repo GPG signing key.
apt-get adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys c615bfaa7fe1b4ca

# Add the repository to your APT sources, replacing <dist> with either jessie or stretch.
echo "deb http://dl.bintray.com/xaptum/deb <dist> main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/xaptum.list

# Install the library.
sudo apt-get install libxtt-cpp-dev libxtt-asio-dev
```

### Homebrew (MacOS)

``` bash
# Tap the Xaptum Homebrew repository.
brew tap xaptum/xaptum

# Install the library.
brew install xtt-cpp xtt-asio
```

## Installation from Source

### Build Dependencies

* CMake (version 3.0 or higher)
* A C++14-compliant compiler
* boost ASIO (version 1.66 or higher)
* [XTT](https://github.com/xaptum/xtt) (version 0.9.0 or higher)

### Building the Library

```bash
# Create a subdirectory to hold the build
mkdir -p build
cd build

# Configure the build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo

# Build the library
cmake --build .

# Run the tests
ctest -V
```

### CMake Options

The following CMake configuration options are supported.

### Installing

```bash
cd build
cmake --build . --target install
```

## Usage
```
#include <xtt/cpp.h>
#include <xtt/asio.h>
```
TODO: Add simple client and server source code

### Example Programs
If the `-DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON` CMake option is used during building,
an example server executable will be built and placed
in the `${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin` directory.
Example configuration data is also provided in the `examples/data`
directory.

#### Server
To run the example server, first copy the necessary example data
into the working directory:
```bash
cp ${xtt_root_directory}/examples/data/server/* .
```

The server executable takes the TCP port to use as parameter:
```bash
xtt_asio_server 4444
```

The server will then listen on that port for incoming identity-provisioning
requests, service them,
and output the agreed-upon identity information exchanged with the client.
